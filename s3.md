**Global Service:**
- S3 (Simple Storage Service) is a global service provided by AWS (Amazon Web Services) for object storage, allowing users to store and retrieve any amount of data at any time.
- Objects are stored as key-value pairs.

**Bucket Characteristics:**
- Buckets must have a globally unique name.
- Buckets are defined at the regional level.

**Object Structure:**
- Objects have a key, which is the full path to the object.
- Key composition: `s3://my_bucket/my_folder/another_folder/my_file.txt`
- The key includes the bucket, prefix, and object name.

**Directory Structure:**
- There's no concept of directories within buckets; instead, keys may contain slashes to mimic folder structures.

**Object Size and Durability:**
- Maximum object size: 5TB.
- Durability: 99.999999999%, often expressed as 11 9's.

**Consistency:**
- S3 delivers strong read-after-write consistency. If an object is overwritten and immediately read, S3 always returns the latest version.

**Bucket Versioning:**
- Versioning is enabled at the bucket level.
- Protects against unintended deletes.
- Allows restoration to a previous version.
- Objects not versioned prior to enabling will have version "null."

**Versioning Management:**
- Suspending versioning does not delete previous versions; it only disables it for the future.
- To restore a deleted object, delete its "delete marker."
- Versioning can only be suspended once enabled.
- Once versioning is enabled, a bucket can never return to an unversioned state.

**Access Management:**
- User-based security is implemented through IAM (Identity and Access Management).
- IAM policies define API calls allowed for a specific user.
- Preferred for fine-grained access control over bucket policies.

**Resource-Based Security (Bucket Policy):**
- Bucket policies grant public access or enforce encryption at upload.
- Facilitates cross-account access.
- IAM principal can access an S3 object if IAM permission or bucket policy allows, and there is no explicit DENY.

**Access Control Lists (ACL):**
- Object ACL applies to objects during upload.
- Bucket ACL is an access policy applying to the entire bucket.

**Object Ownership:**
- By default, an S3 object is owned by the account that uploaded it.
- Object owner must explicitly grant bucket owner access for full access.
- Bucket owners can create policies requiring external users to grant full control to the bucket owner when uploading objects.

**Pre-signed URL:**
- Pre-signed URLs for S3 contain temporary access tokens as query string parameters.
- Temporary access allows anyone with the URL to access the resource before it expires (default 1 hour).
- Inherits the permissions of the user who generated it.
- Use cases include allowing logged-in users to download premium content or allowing users to upload files to a specific location in the bucket.

**S3 Static Websites:**
- Host static websites with client-side scripts accessible on the public internet over HTTP (HTTPS via CloudFront with S3 as the origin).
- Website URLs: `<bucket-name>.s3-website-<region>.amazonaws.com` or `<bucket-name>.s3-website.<region>.amazonaws.com`.
- Ensure bucket policy allows public reads to avoid 403 errors.
- Enable CORS for cross-origin access.

**Replication:**
- Asynchronous replication replicates objects with the same version ID.
- Supports cross-region and cross-account replication.
- Versioning must be enabled for both source and destination buckets.
- Replicates delete markers from source to target (optional), but permanent deletes are not replicated.
- No chaining of replication; objects created in bucket 1 are not replicated to bucket 3 if bucket 2 has replication from bucket 1.

**Storage Classes:**
- Data can be transitioned manually or automatically between storage classes using lifecycle rules.
- Data can be put directly into any storage class.
  
**Standard Storage Class:**
- 99.99% availability.
- Most expensive but offers instant retrieval with no cost on retrieval (only storage cost).
- Suitable for frequently accessed data.

**Infrequent Access (IA) Storage Class:**
- For infrequently accessed data requiring rapid access.
- Lower storage cost than Standard but incurs retrieval costs.
- Transition from Standard to IA can occur only after 30 days.
- Two types: Standard IA (99.9% availability) and One-Zone IA (99.5% availability, data lost if AZ fails).

**Glacier Storage Class:**
- For data archival with storage and retrieval costs.
- Data can be moved into Glacier from Standard at any time.
- Objects cannot be directly accessed; they need to be restored, which may take time depending on the tier.
- Three types: Glacier Instant Retrieval, Glacier Flexible Retrieval, and Glacier Deep Archive.

**Intelligent Tiering Storage Class:**
- 99.9% availability.
- Moves objects automatically between access tiers based on usage.
- Small monthly monitoring and auto-tiering fee.
- No retrieval charges.

**Moving Between Storage Classes:**
- Transition can only happen in the downward direction, as illustrated in the provided diagram.
